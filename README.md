# Bunch of League of Legends scripts

Dependencies: Visual Studio 2013 (aka I know it will work on that)

##Log in 
- build "generate_password_hash" and "Lol_login_v1"
- put the .exe's (found in /Release/) and "systemvariables_login.txt" together in one folder
- run generate_password_hash.exe to make a password file ("pass.txt")
- run Lol_login_v1.exe

##Invite (normal draft)
- build "invite_normal_draft"
- put the .exe (found in /Release/), "systemvariables_invite_normal_draft.txt" and "invite_normal_draft_names" together in one folder
- make sure your LoL is open, in the default position and the "Start" button is avialable
- run invite_normal_draft.exe


###Note on .txt files and "resource_examples"
All .txt files mentioned here are different for each user. I've provided a few examples in resource_examples that work on my machine (---tonlim) and on the machine of a friend (---elite_cart).  
Feel free to try those before making your own.
